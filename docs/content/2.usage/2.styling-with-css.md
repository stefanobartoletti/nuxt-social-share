## Component default styles

The base for visual customization of the `<SocialShare>` buttons are the builtin CSS classes:

- `.social-share-button`
- `.social-share-button--{network name}`
- `.social-share-button--styled` (only if `styled` is set to `true`)
- `.social-share-button__icon`
- `.social-share-button__label`

and the CSS brand color variable, applied to the `<a>` element, and available to all its children:

- `--color-brand`

## CSS Specificity

The component CSS styles are placed inside a `@layer components` CSS layer.

Using a layer ensures a lower specicifity over regualar unlayered CSS, allowing for easy overwriting with your own customizations.
